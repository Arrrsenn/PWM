# PWM
## **PWM for a seven-segment indicator for the ALTERA DE2-115 board**
We compare the pwm variable with the up value, if the condition is true, then 1 (lit), false â€“ 0 (not lit), then iterate these values and at the same time call the timer 12 times for each gorenje. Thus, there is a smooth ignition of the seven-segment indicator and in the reverse action, its smooth extinguishing occurs.
